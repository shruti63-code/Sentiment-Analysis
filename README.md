ðŸ“Œ Project Description â€“ Sentiment Analysis on Tweets

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning to classify tweets as positive or negative. Sentiment analysis is widely used in areas such as brand monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and social media trend tracking, making it a valuable application of AI.

ðŸ”¹ Key Steps Performed:

Created a raw dataset of tweets with sentiment labels (1 = Positive, 0 = Negative).

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand sentiment distribution and text patterns.

Applied text preprocessing techniques, including tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and sequence padding.

Built a Deep Learning model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to capture semantic meaning and sequence dependencies.

Trained the model in Google Colab with GPU support and optimized using Early Stopping to avoid overfitting.

Evaluated performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Deployed a simple prediction function to classify new tweets in real time.

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

TensorFlow / Keras for Deep Learning

NLTK & Regex for text preprocessing

Google Colab for implementation

ðŸ”¹ Outcome:
The trained LSTM model successfully classifies tweets with high accuracy, demonstrating how deep learning can be applied for sentiment analysis on social media data. This project can be extended for multi-class sentiment detection (positive, neutral, negative) or applied to real-world datasets like Twitter API feeds for brand reputation monitoring.
